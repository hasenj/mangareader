        MANGA READER APPLICATION

Goal:
    To create a simple and effecient application for reading manga
    Effeciency in both performance and user interaction.

Description:
    The program will read a directory that contains a specific manga
    within it. The manga, being a series of images sorted alphabetically.
    This manga can be split into multiple directories, so 
    the application must read images in this directory and all its
    subdirectories recursively.

    Images will be presented as a vertical filmstrip where the user
    reads by scrolling down (and up); much like reading a pdf document.

    The application will feature some concepts from vim, such as keyboard
    interaction, a command bar, remembering history, etc.
    
    Main features should be accessible both through keyboard commands and
    graphical elements (gui).

Minimum Requirements:
    * Read (and display) images recursively from a manga directory. [done]
        * Must be lazy; don't read entire directory tree at once. [done]
    * Scroll up/down using k/j keys and mouse wheel. [done]
    * Jump to a certain chapter, or volume/chapter. [done]

Medium Level Requirements:    
    * Treat zip archives as directories
        * And support as many other formats as possible (rar, 7z, etc..) with priority given to FOSS formats.
    * Save/load manga information, such as manga folder and where the user was last time. [wip]
    * Implement bookmarks: allow the user to bookmark a location and jump to it later.
    * Open a command bar when user hits : key.
    * Allow user to resize view (e.g. based on window width)

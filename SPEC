Description:
============

The program reads a directory that contains a specific manga within it. The manga, being a series of images sorted alphabetically.
This manga can be split into multiple directories, so the application reads images in this directory and all its subdirectories recursively.

Images are presented to the user as a vertical filmstrip where the user reads by scrolling down (and up); much like reading a pdf document.

The application will feature some concepts from vim, such as keyboard interaction, a command bar, remembering history, etc.

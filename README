Description:
============

    Read your manga by scrolling images, much like you scroll pages in pdf/ps/djvw documents.

    I don't know how people usually read their manga, but the way manga is packaged, with each chapter in its own directory, people tend to 

    * extract each chapter to a directory 
    * keep a file browser open, 
    * go into a directory, 
       * open the first image in whatever image viewer they have
       * keep hitting next to read the next page
       * go back to the file browser
       * go up a directory
       * move to the next chapter
       * repeat
